BasementLiving - Placeable Bunkers and Basements for Fallout 4

Ever wanted to take a break from the outside world, have a pause from the weather (and settlers?) Ever wanted to store your weapons, Power Armor, and other items in a secure space where they will be left alone? Look no further.

Basement Living adds 10 completely standalone basements & bunkers (interior cells) each with their own standalone workshops and craftable door hatches, allowing you to place/enter into them from any settlement you choose. They work just like Home Plate, so you can tear-down and decorate them however you like! This was done carefully, and methodically, and does not alter ANY existing settlements or interiors whatsoever, nor does it require any batch files, god mode, or other workarounds. They're mostly copies of vanilla cells, so you may recognize a few. I found a couple cool unused cells and copied those too, adding a few things and lighting touches.

Every interior features a fusebox with 100 power, and a control panel to disable/enable the default lighting, fog effects, and trash/debris!  It may not seem like it, but this was three weeks of work to get all the elements set up and working (including replacing lots of floors and walls!) **WHEW!**

These are real interior cells you will 'zone' into, just like vanilla interiors, which makes them a safe place from enemies, weather, and settlers when you feel the need to get away. They act just like a player home. There is a lot of stuff by default to scrap in each location to get you started, and it's easy to just climb up the hatch and grab materials from your main Settlement Workshop if you need more.

This uses vanilla keywords, and as such is fully compatible with Settlement Keywords.

Hatches to "teleport" to the basements are under the Special category. I may change where they are in the menu if there is enough feedback, or require Blueprints in your inventory to keep it clean.

HOW IT WORKS

• Under Special you will find 10 new basement hatches, one for each unique basement. They require 10 metal, 10 wood, 10 concrete, to give the effect of "crafting" the basement, even though you're just crafting a "teleport" door to get in.

• Place a hatch anywhere on the ground of your Settlement. I like to place these behind the house, or in a settlement bedroom.

• Open it up like any door, and you're now in the interior basement cell!

• Enter into Workshop Mode to scrap the interior, and begin decorating it how you like!

• Only one door to each basement can exist at a given time, so if you craft a second door to the same exact basement, the old one will just move to your location, and you will be notified where it moved from. See video for details.

• The interior cell will remain 100% the same as you left it, so you can move the entrance doors around to any settlements with no issues or effects to the interiors.

• NOTE: Currently, if you are over-encumbered, you can't enter into the basement because this mod uses the fast travel system to cleanly move companions with you indoors (it's messy to manage manually.)  I'm working on a solution.  For now, just dump your stuff in the main Workshop before going into a basement ya dingus! :P
